# NPSP Workflow Replacements
This site guides Salesforce Admins using Nonprofit Success Pack in recreating legacy NPSP workflows as Flows instead.  Using Flows instead of workflows allows Admins to take advatage of the benefits of Flows, and also allows Adsmins to move away from workflows as they become obsolete on the Salesforce Platform.
