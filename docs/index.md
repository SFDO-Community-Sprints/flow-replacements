# Open Source Commons (OSC) NPSP & V4S Workflows to Flows
This site guides Salesforce Admins using Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) and Volunteers for Salesforce (V4S) in the recreating of legacy workflows into flows.  

Using Flows instead of workflows allows Admins to take advantage of the benefits of flows, and also help Admins move away from workflows as they become obsolete on the Salesforce platform. 

# Project Overview
This is an Open Source Commons project and has been worked on during Sprints in 2024, 2025, and 2026.

# Vision & Goals
* Design and document Flows to replace all 20 NPSP (v3) and V4S Workflow Rules
* Create unmanaged packages with replacement Flows
* Create documentation that Admins can copy and manually create in their own orgs

# Project Contact 
TBA
